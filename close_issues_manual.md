# GitHub Issues Closure Instructions

## Automatic Closure (Recommended)

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (already done)
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Run the automated script
./close_issues.sh
```

### Option 2: Using GitHub Token
```bash
# Set your GitHub personal access token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"

# Run the automated script
./close_issues.sh
```

## Manual Closure

If automatic closure doesn't work, you can manually close the issues using the following comments:

### Close Issue #1: "test connection to git is broke"

**Comment to add:**
```markdown
## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** The GitHub connection test button was producing an error: `"str" object has no attribute "get"`

**Root Cause:** The error handling in the JavaScript code was trying to access `result.message` but when the backend raised an HTTPException, the response parsing could fail, and there was insufficient type checking for the GitHub API response.

**Solution Implemented:**

### Backend Changes (`web_server.py`):
- Added proper JSON response validation for GitHub API calls
- Added type checking to ensure `user_data` is a dictionary, not a string
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks for JSON parsing
- Added fallback error messages for different response types

### Frontend Changes (`static/js/ide.js`):
- Added proper HTTP error response handling before JSON parsing
- Added fallback error message handling for both `detail` and `message` fields
- Enhanced error handling to check response.ok before parsing JSON
- Added proper error propagation and user feedback

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Fixed the `"str" object has no attribute "get"` error
- ✅ Added robust error handling for all API test buttons (OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub)
- ✅ Better user feedback for connection failures
- ✅ Proper handling of different response formats

**Testing:** The GitHub connection test now properly handles invalid tokens, network errors, and API response issues with clear error messages.

**Commit:** c69d037 - Fix multiple GitHub issues: API configuration persistence, terminal font scaling, and Git connection errors

**Status:** This issue has been resolved and can be closed.

### Close Issue #2: "terminal font size"

**Comment to add:**
```markdown
## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** When increasing the font size in the terminal, the command input location gets scaled off the screen.

**Root Cause:** The terminal container was using fixed padding and margins that didn't account for font size changes. The layout used absolute positioning instead of flexible layout that could adapt to font size changes.

**Solution Implemented:**

### CSS Changes (`templates/ide.html`):
- Converted terminal container to flexbox layout (`display: flex; flex-direction: column`)
- Reduced fixed padding-bottom from 40px to 10px for dynamic sizing
- Added `.terminal-content` with `flex: 1` to take available space
- Updated `.terminal-input` with `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent shrinking
- Added proper overflow handling for terminal content
- Reduced margins to scale better with font size changes

### JavaScript Changes (`static/js/ide.js`):
- Enhanced font size slider to apply changes immediately to all terminal elements
- Updated `setupSettingsListeners()` to handle real-time font size changes
- Modified `applySettings()` to properly set font size on container, output, and input
- Added proper font inheritance for terminal container and all child elements

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Terminal input no longer scales off screen with larger fonts
- ✅ Real-time font size changes apply immediately without needing save/reload
- ✅ Proper flexbox layout adapts to different font sizes
- ✅ Both editor and terminal font size sliders work correctly
- ✅ Maintains proper spacing and layout at all font sizes

**Testing:** Font size can now be increased to large values without the input field disappearing or becoming inaccessible.
